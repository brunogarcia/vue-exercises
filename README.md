For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).

## Backpack

We use [backpack](https://github.com/palmerhq/backpack) to watch and build the application, so you can use the latest ES6 features (module syntax, async/await, etc.).

## Components Library

We are using [Vuetifyjs](https://vuetifyjs.com) wich is a [Material Design](http://material.io/) components library for Vue.

## Animations

For the animations I'm using vue's core own capabilities and CSS. I also added [Popmotion](https://popmotion.io) for some other more complex animations.
